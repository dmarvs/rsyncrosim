\arguments{
\item{model}{A model type or a SyncroSim Project or Scenario. Optional when loading an existing library using a name.}

\item{name}{A library file name or library file path. If not a path library is created or opened in the current working directory.}

\item{session}{A SyncroSim \code{Session}. If NULL, the default SyncroSim Session will be used.}

\item{addons}{One or more addons. See addons() for options.}

\item{backup}{If TRUE, a backup copy is made when an existing library is opened.}

\item{backupName}{Added to a library filepath to create a backup library.}

\item{backupOverwrite}{If TRUE, the existing backup of a library (if any) will be overwritten.}
}
\value{
An \code{SSimLibrary} object representing a SyncroSim library.
}
\description{
Creates or opens an \code{\link{SSimLibrary}} object representing a SyncroSim library.
}
\details{
\itemize{
  \item {If model is SyncroSim Project or Scenario: }{Returns the \code{\link{SSimLibrary}} associated with the Project or Scenario.}
  \item {If given no name and no model: }{Opens an existing SyncroSim library in
  the current working directory - returns an error if more than one library exists. If library does not exist and only one model is installed - creates a library of that type.}
  \item {If given a model but no name: }{Opens or creates a library called <model>.ssim in the current working directory.}
  \item {If given a name but no model: }{Attempts to open a library of that name. Returns an error if that library does not already exist.}
  \item {If given a name and a model: }{Opens or creates a library called <name>.ssim. Returns an error if the library already exists but is a different type of model.}
}

\item \code{Scenario}: Get the SSimLibrary associated with a SyncroSim Scenario.

# Create or load a library using a specific session

# Add a project and get the library associated with that project
