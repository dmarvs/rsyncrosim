GUIDE TO INSTALLING OR MODIFYING RSYNCROSIM - DEVELOPMENT VERSION
========================================================

***********************************
TO VIEW THE CODE ON GITHUB
***********************************
1) If you haven't done so, get a github account and ask Leonardo to add you to the ApexRMS organization.
2) Log in to github.
3) Find development code in the R directory at https://github.com/ApexRMS/dev.rsyncrosim. Eventually the
master repository (https://github.com/ApexRMS/rsyncrosim) will give public access to the package - for now we will
use the development branch.

*************************************************
TO INSTALL OR UPDATE THE DEVELOPMENT VERSION OF THE PACKAGE
*************************************************
1) Make sure you can read the repository: https://github.com/ApexRMS/dev.rsyncrosim
2) Get an access token (PAT) with repo scope: https://github.com/settings/tokens
3) Put this code in an installRSyncroSim.R script on your local drive:
  # Run to install the development version of rsyncrosim.
  # This should be done only once at the beginning of a session.
  # Reinstalling rsyncrosim later in a session may cause problems with the help files:
  #   Warning message: In fetch(key) : internal error -3 in R_decompress1
  # If this happens, the solution is to restart R. Ctrl + Shift +10 in RStudio.
  installSet = setdiff(c("devtools"),installed.packages()[,"Package"])
  if(length(installSet)) install.packages(installSet)
  devtools::install_github("ApexRMS/dev.rsyncrosim",ref="dev",auth_token="yourPAT")
4) Run installRSyncroSim.R at the beginning of each session to update rsyncrosim.

Note that reinstalling rsyncrosim during a session may corrupt the help files. If this occurs the solution is to restart R: Ctrl+Shift+10 in RStudio

*************************************************
TO DOWNLOAD A TUTORIAL SCRIPT FROM GITHUB
*************************************************
1) Navigate to the file you want. e.g. https://github.com/ApexRMS/dev.rsyncrosim/blob/dev/TutorialsAndExamples/STSimSpatialTutorial.R
2) Press the "Raw" button (upper right corner)
3) Copy and paste the raw code to a blank script file and save.

**************************
TO EDIT THE CODE ON GITHUB
**************************
1) An ApexRMS administrator must add you to the rsyncrosim development team or make you a collaborator.
2) Note that the NAMESPACE and package documentation (.Rda) files are generated automatically from "' comments
in the .R files using roxygen2. Direct modifications of the NAMESPACE and .Rda files will be lost.
To revise the documentation edit the "' comments.

*******************************************
TO CHECK OUT A LOCAL COPY OF THE REPOSITORY
*******************************************
NOTE: This is only necessary if you anticipate doing a lot of work on the code. For minor changes, a simpler
(and safer) solution is to edit the files on github. Users with a local copy and write privileges must take
responsibility for using git properly.
1) Set up Git: https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/
2) Setup Git on RStudio and Associate with GitHub: https://www.r-bloggers.com/rstudio-and-github/
3) Clone the GitHub project to new RStudio project: https://www.r-bloggers.com/rstudio-and-github/.
The repository url is https://[username]@github.com/ApexRMS/rsyncrosim.git and the remote origin
url is git@github.com:ApexRMS/rsyncrosim.git
4) Add the development branch. In the git bash:
   git checkout -b dev
   git remote add private git@github.com:ApexRMS/dev.rsyncrosim.git
   git pull private dev
   git push -u private dev
5) Use the RStudio GUI to commit and push changes to github. Please ensure you are committing to the dev branch, not the master.
6) To run build and run the package from local files (instead of the github repository), use the following lines of code:
   # To build from local copy of repository
   setwd("Path to your local copy of the package source files")
   devtools::document()     # builds documentation from the local copy
   devtools::load_all()     # replaces library command for use with local copy
   # Note: library(rsyncrosim) will invoke the github copy. Don't invoke if working with a local copy!
